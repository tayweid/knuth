# Complete a Claerbout app with Electron's framework (APP.md, "Electron, one
# shell for Claerbout"). An app ships without it (286 of Electron's 288 MB);
# this puts it in: cloned from an installed Claerbout app with the same
# bytes on the same volume, which on APFS takes no space, or else
# downloaded from Electron's release on GitHub and checked against its
# published SHA-256 sums and the hash the app records.
#
#   complete.sh <App.app> [status-file] [sibling.app ...]
#
# Run by the app's launcher on a launch that finds no framework, and by the
# install line. With a status file, progress goes there as "percent|text"
# lines (percent empty when unknown), for the launcher's window. Apps named
# after it are looked at first as siblings: the install line names the app
# an update replaces.
#
# Overrides, for testing: CLAERBOUT_SIBLINGS (folders to look in for a
# sibling instead of the Applications folders; empty means none),
# ELECTRON_MIRROR (where Electron's releases are).
